# Privacy Statement

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice: Volunteer-Maintained Project

BirdNET-Go is a hobby project maintained by volunteers in their spare time. While we are committed to protecting your privacy and following best practices, our capacity to respond to requests and provide support is limited by volunteer availability. This privacy statement reflects our sincere efforts to be transparent about data practices, but please understand that responses may be delayed during busy periods or personal circumstances.

BirdNET-Go is committed to protecting your privacy while providing reliable bird sound identification software. This privacy statement explains what data we collect, how we protect it, and your rights regarding data collection.

## üîí Important: Completely Opt-In Data Collection

**BirdNET-Go collects ZERO data by default.** All telemetry and support data collection is:

- ‚úÖ **Completely Optional** - Never enabled without your explicit consent
- ‚úÖ **Opt-In Only** - You must actively choose to enable telemetry
- ‚úÖ **No Hidden Collection** - Nothing is transmitted without your knowledge
- ‚úÖ **User Controlled** - Enable or disable anytime with immediate effect

**By default, BirdNET-Go operates locally with minimal external data transmission.** The only default external connections are:

- **Weather data**: Read-only requests to YR.no (Norway's meteorological service) for weather information
- **Bird images**: Read-only requests to Wikimedia Commons and AviCommons for bird photos

**All other external integrations require explicit user configuration and are disabled by default.**

## Privacy Principles

BirdNET-Go follows **Privacy by Design** principles:

- **Data Minimization**: Only essential technical data is collected for debugging
- **Explicit Consent**: All telemetry requires explicit opt-in activation
- **Transparency**: Complete disclosure of data collection practices
- **User Control**: Users can enable/disable telemetry at any time
- **Data Protection**: All data is anonymized before transmission

## Data Collection and External Integrations

### Default External Connections (No Personal Data)

**Weather Services** (enabled by default):
- **YR.no API**: Read-only requests for weather data using your configured coordinates
- **Data sent**: Only HTTP requests with latitude/longitude parameters
- **Purpose**: Correlate weather patterns with bird detection for better insights
- **Privacy**: No registration required, no personal data, no tracking

**Image Services** (enabled by default):
- **Wikimedia Commons & AviCommons**: Download bird photos for web interface
- **Data sent**: Only HTTP GET requests for public images
- **Purpose**: Display bird photos in the web dashboard
- **Privacy**: Read-only requests, no personal data transmitted

### Optional External Integrations (Require User Configuration)

**BirdWeather Integration** (disabled by default):
- **Purpose**: Share bird detections with the citizen science platform
- **Data sent**: 3-second audio clips, species data, randomized location coordinates
- **Requires**: User account registration and station ID configuration
- **Privacy protection**: Location randomized within user-defined accuracy radius

**MQTT Broker Integration** (disabled by default):
- **Purpose**: Publish bird detection events to external MQTT brokers
- **Data sent**: Bird detection information (species, confidence, timestamp, optional audio)

### Telemetry Data Collection (Opt-In Only)

**IMPORTANT: The following telemetry data is ONLY collected when you explicitly enable it. By default, NO telemetry data is collected.**

### ‚úÖ Technical Error Information (When Telemetry is Enabled)

**Error Messages & Context**
- Anonymized error messages for debugging software issues
- Component names where errors occur (e.g., "ffmpeg-process", "rtsp-connection")
- System resource errors (memory, disk space issues)
- Network connection patterns and retry attempts

**System Information**
- Operating system and architecture (Linux/Windows/macOS, ARM64/AMD64)
- Hardware specs (CPU count, memory amount)
- Container environment detection (Docker/Podman)
- Board model (only for ARM64 Linux systems like Raspberry Pi)

**Privacy Protection Applied**:
- URLs and credentials are automatically anonymized using SHA-256 hashing
- File paths and user directories are never transmitted
- Original RTSP URLs become anonymous identifiers like "url-abc123def456"

### ‚úÖ Support Data Collection (When You Manually Create Support Packages)

**System Information**
- OS details, hardware specifications, runtime information
- Disk usage and container information for troubleshooting

**Log Files**
- Application logs with sensitive information automatically scrubbed
- Configuration data with passwords/tokens/secrets replaced with "[REDACTED]"
- System journal logs (Linux systemd environments)

**Privacy Protection Applied**:
- All sensitive configuration keys automatically redacted
- URLs anonymized in log files
- User control over what data to include in support packages

### ‚ùå Data We NEVER Collect (Telemetry)

**Note**: The following applies to telemetry data collection. Optional integrations like BirdWeather may transmit some of this data when explicitly configured by users.

- **Personal audio recordings** (except 3-second clips for BirdWeather when configured)
- **Continuous bird detection results** (except when shared via configured integrations)
- **Actual RTSP URLs, IP addresses, or hostnames** (anonymized in telemetry)
- **Usernames, passwords, or authentication credentials**
- **File paths** or directory structures  
- **Personal configuration settings** (except when included in support packages)
- **Precise location data** (coordinates used only for weather/BirdWeather when configured)
- **Device identifiers** or hardware serial numbers
- **Network topology** or internal IP addresses

### ‚ùå Data Never Transmitted by Default

- **No bird detection data** shared without explicit integration setup
- **No audio recordings** transmitted without BirdWeather configuration
- **No location information** sent without weather service or BirdWeather setup
- **No personal information** of any kind

## System Identification

BirdNET-Go uses a **unique System ID** for correlating error reports:

- **Format**: Random 12-character identifier (e.g., "A1B2-C3D4-E5F6")
- **Generation**: Created locally using cryptographically secure random numbers
- **Storage**: Stored only in your local configuration directory
- **Purpose**: Allows developers to correlate error reports without identifying users
- **Privacy**: Cannot be linked to you unless you explicitly share it

## Data Anonymization

### URL Protection Process

1. **Detection**: Automatic identification of URLs in error messages
2. **Component Analysis**: URLs are broken into scheme, host, port, and path
3. **Host Categorization**: 
   - `localhost` for local connections
   - `private-ip` for internal networks  
   - `public-ip` for internet addresses
   - `domain-com` for .com domains (TLD only)
4. **Consistent Hashing**: SHA-256 creates anonymous but consistent identifiers
5. **Structure Preservation**: Maintains debugging value without exposing sensitive data

### Example Anonymization

| Original URL | Anonymized Result | Information Preserved |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| `rtsp://admin:pass@192.168.1.100:554/stream1` | `url-b0c823d0454e766694949834` | Protocol, private network, port, stream type |
| `http://camera.example.com/api/live` | `url-8a6d125351c079f9d0a27598` | Protocol, .com domain, API structure |
